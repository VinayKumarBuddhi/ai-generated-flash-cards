Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent leader in India's struggle for independence against British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was a brilliant student who later joined the Indian freedom movement. Bose was known for his strong nationalist views and radical approach to achieving independence. He became the president of the Indian National Congress in 1938 but later parted ways due to ideological differences with Mahatma Gandhi.

Bose is best known for establishing the Indian National Army (INA) and seeking international support to free India. During World War II, he allied with Germany and Japan, famously coining the slogan "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom!" His efforts led to the formation of the Azad Hind Government in 1943. However, his sudden disappearance in a plane crash in 1945 remains a mystery, sparking numerous theories about his fate.

Subhas Chandra Bose remains a symbol of bravery and patriotism in India, with his legacy inspiring generations. His contributions to India's independence are honored every year, particularly on Parakram Diwas, celebrated on his birth anniversary.
